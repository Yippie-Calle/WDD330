        Chapter 2 Programing Basics<br>
        • Comments –<br>
        well-commented code is the hallmark of a ninja programmer. It makes it easier for anybody reading your code to
        understand what’s going on, and that includes you!<br>
        • JavaScript Grammar<br>
        Similar to C programming language.<br>
        There’s no need to actually use a semicolon to terminate a statement because JavaScript interpreters use a
        process called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).<br>
         What if the code goes to long and needs two lines? How do we go about doing that? Like in JAVA would we do a +
        and space then continue on a new line? Or do we just write a really long line of code?<br>
         Then another thought when do we say a line/statement of code too long?<br>
        • Reserved Words.<br>
        the following words cannot be used as variables for they are already used by default things for JavaScript<br>
        abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete,
        do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements,
        import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public,
        return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var,
        volatile, void, while, with, yield<br>
        • Variables<br>
        From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to declare variables. The keyword const is used
        when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas let is used if the variable might be
        reassigned later in the program.<br>
        • Scope<br>
        Scope is an important concept in programming. It refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the
        program. There are two common scopes that are often referred to in programs: global scope and local scope.<br>
        outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is accessible everywhere in the program.<br>
        local scope. This means that any variables defined inside a block using the let or const will only be
        available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block.<br>
