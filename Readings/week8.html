    <h1>Transforms and Transitions</h1>
    <ul>Transforms
        <li>transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
        <li>We can manipulate an element’s appearance usingtransform functions. </li>
        <li> The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be
            applied in the order they’re provided</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Translation
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. </li>
        <li>similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left , moving elements up and down or
            left and right along the x and y axes</li>
        <li>Unlike position: relative , which allows you to position an element either against its current position or
            against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.
        </li>
        <li>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Scaling
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. </li>
        <li>If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your
            element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio.</li>
        <li>As with translate , you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions will scale only
            the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively.</li>
        <li>Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform would override
            the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We
            simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.</li>
        <li>Transforming does not cause a reflow.</li>
        <li>It’s also worth remembering that scaling, like translation, has no impact on the document flow.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Rotation
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
        <li>by default the point of origin is the element’s center.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Skew
        <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. </li>
        <li>As with translate and scale , there are axis-specific versions of the skew transform: skewX() and skewY() .
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Changing the Origin of the Transform
        <li>you can control the origin from which your transforms are applied</li>
        <li>transform-origin property has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the
            center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default)</li>
        <li>the default transform-origin is the center of the circle, applying a rotate() transform to a circle would
            have no visible effect—a circle rotated 90 degrees still looks exactly the same as it did before being
            rotated</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Note: Choose Your Ordering Carefully
        <li>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction
            will be on the rotated axis. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Transitions
        <li>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally
            require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear smoother</li>
        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations
        </li>
        <li>with the CSS transition property the color transition can be gradual.</li>
        <li>CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element.</li>
        <ol>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:
        </ol>
        <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
        <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
        <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties,
            including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay .
            We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with
            all for all properties being the default.</li>
        <li>Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid midpoint can be transitioned.
        </li>
        <li>The exception to this “if there is a valid midpoint, it can be transitioned” rule is visibility: although
            there is no valid midpoint between the values visible and hidden , when transitioned, the value changes at
            the endpoint of the transition. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h1>
    <ul>Canvas
        <li>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. </li>
        <li> we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power
            to manipulate pixels in images and even video.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>A Bit of Canvas History
        <li>Canvas was first developed by Apple</li>
        <li>If you aspire to do development for the iPhone or iPad (referred to jointly as iOS), or for the Mac, what
            you learn in canvas should help you understand some of the basic concepts of Quartz 2D.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Creating a canvas Element
        <li>
            <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
                Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
            </canvas>
        </li>
</body>
<script>
    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
    context.strokeStyle = "red";
    context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";
    context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
    context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
