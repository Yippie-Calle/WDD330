    <p>
        Doing stuff with Web Things:<br>
        Info stored or shared with the user is called output.<br>
        Anything coming in from where it was stored or anything the user enters is called input.<br>
        Important to include a tag that allows the user to tell you the name of the story.<br>
        The placeholder is a property specific to textarea and input tags. It’s like a hint for users to know what to
        type in your text area.<br>
        Remember 'style' is for CSS and 'script'is for Javascript<br>
        when you are adding them directly to HTML What is the main difference between Div and Section? <br>
        Var is javascript way to create a variable. Javascript is more similar to object-oriented languages than HTML
        and CSS. <br>
        When you want to get the user’s input or text area tag you use ‘value’. <br>
        When you want to show something to a user you use the section and the special word innerHTML. <br>
        Textarea=value <br>
        Section=inner html
        After spending time learning Java and python. Is it encouraged to do comments in your code? Looks like from the
        reading and examples comments weren’t written out.
