    <h1>Chapter 9 - The window Object</h1>

    <ul>
        <h2>The Browser Model </h2>
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
        <li>There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties and methods that are
            supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto standard</li>
        <li>Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM only makes sense in a browser
            environment. This means that other environments (such as Node.js) probably won’t have a window object,
            although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js has an object called global .</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Going Global</h2>
        <li>global variables. These are variables that are created without using the const , let or var keywords. Global
            variables can be accessed in all parts of the program</li>
        <li>In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object; it’s less typing and your
            code will be more portable between environments.</li>
        <li>ES6 made parseInt() and isNaN() methods of the Number object,</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Dialogs</h2>
        <li>three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert() , confirm() and prompt() .</li>
        <li>the window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.
        </li>
        <li>he window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that
            shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel.</li>
        <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Chapter 14 - HTML5 API </h1>

<ul>
    <h2>HTML5 </h2>
    <li>HTML5 was for HTML what ES6 was for JavaScript – it added a large number of new features to the specification.
        It also went beyond the actual markup language and brought together a number of related technologies such as CSS
        and JavaScript. </li>
    <li>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different
        paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed. It also means that when a
        previously unforeseen development occurs, a new module can be created to cater for it. Modules can be at
        different stages of maturity, from ideas to full implementation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2>The data- Attribute</h2>
    <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the
        browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole
        purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
    <li>the information contained in the attributes can be used to identify particular elements.</li>
    <li>The support for the data- attribute is generally very good in modern browsers. Even Internet Explorer 8 has
        partial support! Some older browsers are unable to understand the dataset property, however, but any data-
        attribute can be found using the standard getAttribute method. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2>HTML5 APIss</h2>
    <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras,
        batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h2>HTML5 Web Storage</h2>
    <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has
        fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. </li>
    <li>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:

        Information stored isnotshared with the server on every request.

        Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).

        Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the
        specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).

        Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better
        choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
