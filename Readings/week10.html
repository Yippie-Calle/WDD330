    <h1>MDN: Validating Forms</h1>
    <ul>
      Client side form validation
      <li>
        Client side Validation, making sure everything is filled out and in
        correct format.
      </li>
      <li>
        Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of
        good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the
        user can fix it straight away.
      </li>
      <li>
        client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security
        measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any
        form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side,
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Form Validation?
      <li>
        When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see
        that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by
        the application
      </li>
      <li>
        Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while
        validation done on the server is called server-side validation.
      </li>
      <li>Three reason to making validating easy</li>
      <li>We want to get the right data, in the right format.</li>
      <li>We want to protect our users' data.</li>
      <li>We want to protect ourselves.</li>
      <li>
        Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your
        form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the
        client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Different Types of client-side validation
      <li>
        Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which
        we've discussed in many places throughout this module.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is
        completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a
        library).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Using built-in form validation
      <li>
        One of the most significant features of HTML5 form controls is the
        ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before
        the form can be submitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of
        textual data (strings)
      </li>
      <li>
        min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input
        types
      </li>
      <li>
        type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address,
        or some other specific preset type.
      </li>
      <li>
        pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the
        entered data needs to follow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note: There are several errors that will prevent the form from being
        submitted, including a badInput, patternMismatch, rangeOverflow or
        rangeUnderflow, stepMismatch, tooLong or tooShort, typeMismatch,
        valueMissing, or a customError.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example Form Validation</h2>
    <!-- <form>
      <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or cherry?</label>
      <input id="choose" name="i_like" />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form> -->
    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="choose"
          name="i_like"
          required
          minlength="6"
          maxlength="6"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="number">How many would you like?</label>
        <input
          type="number"
          id="number"
          name="amount"
          value="1"
          min="1"
          max="10"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    <h1>Using Fetch</h1>
    <p>
      The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and
      manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other
      technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also provides a single logical
      place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to
      HTTP.
