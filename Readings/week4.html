<p>
   When Reading the Object Oriented chapter I got excited, because the past few sememters I learned alot of Object Oriented Languages. <br>
   'All web browsers can run JavaScript, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world' - When I read this quote made me wonder what language should I really be studying. <br>
   So recently in the news you hear alot about Cryptocurrency. When they speak about that they some times speak about Web3.0... is this about to be released? Am I learning programing during a web upgrade?<br>
   JavaScriptâ€™s main environment is the browser, but can also be used in other environments.<br>
   So, from my understanding we will need react or Vue.js to actually use Javascript outside of a web version?
